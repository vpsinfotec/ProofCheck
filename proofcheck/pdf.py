"""PDF text extraction (pdfplumber) with an optional, deterministic OCR fallback.

The primary path pulls each page's embedded text layer — fully deterministic, no
guessing. Pages with no extractable text (scanned/image-only) are reported so the
caller can warn and skip them.

When ``ocr=True`` those no-text-layer pages are handed to :mod:`proofcheck.ocr`, which
renders and runs Tesseract over them. OCR is optional and deterministic (same image +
DPI -> same text); if the OCR libraries/engine are missing the pages stay warned +
skipped exactly as before. We still never *guess* — OCR only recovers real glyphs.
