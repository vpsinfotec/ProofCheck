"""Plain-language presentation helpers shared by the HTML and xlsx reports.

The data contract keeps the terse machine statuses (``EXACT``/``FUZZY``/``MISSING``/
``SKIPPED``) and numeric scores. Non-technical readers find those confusing, so this module
turns them into ordinary English: "Found", "Found with differences", "Not found", "Blank",
plus a one-sentence overview and a per-row explanation of where each value was (or wasn't)
found. Presentation only — it has no effect on matching and doesn't change the API.
