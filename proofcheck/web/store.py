"""Persistent storage for users and run history (stdlib ``sqlite3``).

Deliberately dependency-free and offline: SQLite ships with Python, needs no server,
and keeps ProofCheck installable with zero infrastructure. This backs two optional web
features — **auth** (a users table) and **persistent run history** (a runs table).

The database location is ``$PROOFCHECK_DB`` (default: ``<tempdir>/proofcheck/proofcheck.db``).
Every call opens its own short-lived connection, which is the simplest correct pattern
under FastAPI's threadpool (each worker thread gets its own connection). Schema creation
is idempotent (``CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS``) so there is no separate migration step.

This module stores only **non-PII run metadata** (filenames + summary counts + flags) so
history survives the short-lived report cache. The uploaded spreadsheets/PDFs themselves
are still deleted immediately after each run, exactly as before.
