"""Optional, deterministic OCR fallback for PDF pages with no text layer.

ProofCheck's defining rule is **100% deterministic, no AI/LLM/ML, offline**. Classic
Tesseract OCR fits that rule: it is a fixed, offline glyph recogniser, not a learned
generative model, and the same image rendered the same way always yields the same text.

**Engine (tuned for accuracy + robustness).** Each page is rendered with pypdfium2, then
OCR is attempted with several deterministic *strategies* and the most confident result is
kept:

  * several preprocessings — grayscale + auto-contrast, Otsu **binarization** (clean
    black-on-white, which Tesseract reads best on noisy/low-contrast scans), an Otsu over
    the **channel-minimum** (``min(R,G,B)``) that turns *coloured* logo lettering — gold /
    gradient / outlined fills that luminance grayscale washes almost white — into solid
    dark glyphs, and (for transparent images) the alpha channel used directly as the text
    mask;
  * several page-segmentation modes — the default is **psm 6** (a single uniform text
    block), which reads multi-line title/logo pages whole; ``--ocr-psm`` overrides it and
    psm 3/4 are tried as fallbacks, important because automatic segmentation (psm 3)
    sometimes returns nothing on sparse, centred pages.

The winner is chosen by how much *confident* text it produced, so a page that one strategy
fails on is recovered by another. All of this is deterministic (a fixed strategy set + a
deterministic tie-break), preserving same-input-same-output.

**Limits.** Tesseract is trained on ordinary document fonts. Heavily stylized **display /
logo lettering** (3D, metallic/gradient, outlined, decorative) is at or beyond its limits —
no preprocessing reliably reads it. Use :func:`diagnose` / ``proofcheck ocr`` to see the
per-page text + confidence (and the image fed to OCR) so you can tell a fixable scan issue
(low DPI, rotation, noise → improvable) from genuinely un-OCR-able artwork.

Optional feature: rendering needs ``pypdfium2``; OCR needs ``pytesseract`` + ``Pillow`` plus
the Tesseract binary on PATH. When any is missing, OCR is unavailable and no-text-layer
pages stay warned + skipped. Install: ``pip install 'proofcheck[ocr]'`` + the engine binary.
